## Can I sell games made with it?

```{admonition} Note:

I'm not a lawyer, and the following is not legal advice!
```

Pyrite64 itself is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/HailToDodongo/pyrite64/blob/main/LICENSE),\
and I put no restrictions on what you can do with games.\
The SDKs used, namely libdragon and tiny3d, have similar licenses.\
Pyrite64 does **NOT** use any proprietary SDKs.\
So in general, it should be safe to sell games made with Pyrite64 if you wish.

## Can I put games on a physical cartridge?

Yes!\
Pyrite64 produces playable ROMs that can be put on flashcards.\
The SDK used (libdragon) requires a CIC 6102.

Once again, Pyrite64 does **NOT** use any proprietary SDKs.\
So the IPL3 is open source and **NOT** taken from a game.
